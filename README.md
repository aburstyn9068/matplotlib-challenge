Matplotlib Project

This repository containts the code to analyze the data from an anti-cancer pharmaceutical study. The code was written using a Jupyter Notebook and utilizes the matplotlib, scipy, numpy, and pandas libraries for analysis.

The code produces the following analysis:
    - A bar graph showing the total number of measurements taken for each drug regimen
    - A pie chart showing the distribution of male/female mice
    - A comparison of the final tumor values for the Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin regiemns. This comparison includes a calculation of potential outliers in the data and a box and whisker plot visually reprensenting the data and potential outliers.
    - A line graph of weight vs. tumor volume for mouse y793 in the Capomulin treatment group. The graph can be adjusted to look at any mouse in the data group by changing the "mouse" variable to the desired Mouse ID.
    - A comparison of mouse weight and average tumor volume. This comparison includes a calculation of the correlation coefficient and linear regression model between the data, as well as a scatter plot depicting the data and linear regression.

The notebook also contains obserations and inferences made based on the data analysis.
